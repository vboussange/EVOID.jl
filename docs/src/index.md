# EvoId.jl

EvoId.jl (for **Evo**lutionary **I**n**d**ividual-based models) is a package aimed at simulating the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a population in a multidimensional space, at the individual level. The dynamics is specified under the framework of [stochastic models for structured populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04165).
